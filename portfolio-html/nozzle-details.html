                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  The heated nozzle enclosure that I developed for the Robotic Matter Lab was designed to heat a specialized viscous material to 90°C that would then be extruded through a nozzle. The system was mounted on a gantry that allowed for the material to be 3D printed. The temperature was regulated by a PID controller connected to two heater cartridges in parallel and an RTD probe. The enclosure was machined out of aluminum using a mill and CNC and the wiring was all done manually. 
                </p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>
                  When I joined the Robotic Matter Lab, I was given the project of developing a heated nozzle system to 3D print specialized materials developed by the lab. There was already a set nozzle that we would use, and all I had to do was develop an enclosure that would bring it to a certain temperature. We decided to make our enclosure out of aluminum, since it’s easily machinable and conducts heat well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the beginning, we developed a CAD model that we would first 3D print to confirm fits and then later machine. The CAD model was pretty simple, it consisted of two halves that clamped together and had the nozzle cavity in the middle. We didn’t want to add anything too complex since we would have to machine it out of metal, and a heater block doesn’t need special geometry. From my experience with fitting parts together, I knew that having the nozzle cavity be the exact cutout of the nozzle itself would not fit. I had to add some clearance between the two for it to fit easily. So I printed the enclosure prototypes with 0, 0.2, and 0.4 millimeters of XY clearance. After testing, the 0.2mm clearance fit the nozzle the best. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we had a prototype that we were satisfied with, we machined the part out of aluminum. The PhD student I was working with machined the housing of the enclosure, and I used a CNC to machine the nozzle cavity.
