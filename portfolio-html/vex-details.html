              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
              In my senior year of high school, I participated in the Vex Tower Takeover competition, where the objective was to build a robot that could score 
              as many cubes as possible in the goal zones. The small goal zones implied the cubes had to be stacked, which posed a significant 
              challenge since all robots had to fit within an 18‚Äù cube at the beginning of the match. Towers with single-cube buckets would 
              also add a point multiplier towards the color of a scored cube (there were three colors total). 
              </p>
              <p>
              This was my fourth year competing and my second year leading team 285Z. We were coming from a pretty successful season, having won
              13 awards, the Texas State Championship, and advancing to elimination quarterfinals at the world championship. I was a programmer, 
              team leader, chief engineer, and driver, so I had a lot of responsibilities to juggle. I designed a majority of the robot with 
              the help of a few other friends, and it ended up being one of my proudest engineering accomplishments because of its mechanical 
              complexity and performance. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The robot had a total of 8 motors - 4 for the drive train, 2 for the intake, 1 for the angler, and 1 for the lift. 
                The angler was for tilting the tray so that the stack of cubes could be deposited in the goal zone. The lift was for a simple
                 two bar (that the intakes were mounted on) that would lift a cube up and score it in a bucket tower. The robot could 
                 consistently score a maximum of 10 cubes in the zone. The most complex part of the robot was the fold-out mechanism. Since
                  all robots had to fit within an 18 inch cube at the beginning of the match, it was challenging to find ways of keeping 
                  all mechanisms, especially the tray, within size constraints. To solve this, we built in a total of 4 flip-out mechanisms: 
                  the tray, anti-tip, intakes, and the intake hard-stops. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The tray was composed of three main stages that folded within each other to fit within size limits at the beginning of a match.
                 The anti-tip was designed by a team member, and slid out on linear rails once the angler was activated using a rubber band 
                 system. The intakes were on joints and would fall down once the lift was activated, and each intake unit had a flip-out lock
                  that would prevent the intake from rotating once deployed. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Our robot was overall a success. We won the skills championship at the state tournament along with the Think Award, and
                 made it to the semifinals before losing to our sister teams (who were also the eventual winners of the tournament). 
                 This qualified us for the world championship that was unfortunately canceled, and marked our third year in a row as state
                  skills champion. Throughout the season, we won 10 awards in total, including 2 tournament champions and 2 skills champions.
