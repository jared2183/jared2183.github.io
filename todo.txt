Portfolio:
- voron project
- nozzle enclosure
- high school robotics 2020
- linkage project
- sample rack
- triple pendulum simulation
- phone case project?
- overwatch logo CNC?
- ticketing system?
- ctec scraper?

UI: 
- add fading animation to "Hi there" and "I'm Jared" separately (similar to apple)
- replace white background with gradient
- have the entire image for portfolios be clickable to view more

Functional:
- add captions to photos in slideshow
- embed youtube links in slideshow for videos
- potentially have a single portfolio details template and a js script that loads the unique content stored in an array or something (so I don't have to copy paste a single formatting change 5x)

Potential:
- maybe add back the services section and rename to interests

Done:
- add google analytics to website to see how many people view it
- make portfolio information scrollable instead of slideshow
