                  <li><strong>Summary</strong>: 
                    A magnetic linkage-based model to simulate self-assembling networks. This was done in partnership
                    with the Keten Research Group at Northwestern. All linkages were fabricated using 3D printing, and
                    magnets were embedded with a specialized aligner to orient the dipoles.

              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of this project was to design a physical simulation for self-healing network configurations to validate results from previous digital simulations conducted in Python. This project was completed for a PhD student from the Keten Research Group, who consulted with the Sun lab for help in using 3D printing to fabricate the linkages. I designed, fabricated, and tested the magnetic linkages, and also incorporated feedback from the client into the final design. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The self-assembly model used diametrically magnetized magnets that had their dipoles oriented at prescribed angles. The biggest challenge was figuring out how to precisely orient the magnet’s dipole and lock the orientation when inserting it into the linkage. I developed many prototypes for this, and ultimately settled on a two-piece aligner, where the magnet would first attach to a freely-rotating lid that would then press together with the base containing the linkage body. This pressing action would also embed the magnet within the linkage, resulting in an interference fit. The rotating lid allowed for the magnetic dipole to be oriented in 30 degree increments, and the guide holes made sure the alignment was precise. I embedded magnets within the lid that would both keep the magnet secured and also align its dipoles. I printed the aligner prototypes on the Makerbot Method X out of ABS.
              </p>
              <p>
                The linkage itself wasn’t very complicated. Initially I had a tapered middle rod connecting the magnetic ends to minimize any interference from it, but this resulted in the linkages forming into unwanted close-packed configurations. I also used an interference fit to hold the magnets in place since I thought glue would be too messy and annoying to use, and I also had some experience with fits from the sample racks. The final linkage had a very simple and straightforward design, with flat walls and an empty center cavity. All of the linkages were printed out of Grey Pro resin on the Formlabs Form 3B printer.
